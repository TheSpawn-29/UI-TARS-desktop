The changes primarily involve updates to two files:\n\n1. **`console-interceptor.ts`**\n2. **`index.tsx`**\n\n### Key Modifications:\n- Removal of unused properties in the `ConsoleInterceptor` class.\n- Replacement of `motion.div` with a regular `div` in `index.tsx` to simplify the layout and avoid flickering.\n\n## Potential Issues and Bugs\n1. **`console-interceptor.ts`**:\n   - The file removes private properties `originalStdout` and `originalStderr`. Ensure these are not required elsewhere in the codebase.\n   - Check if removing these properties impacts any functionality outside the scope of this PR.\n\n2. **`index.tsx`**:\n   - Altering `motion.div` to `div` might reduce animation-related capabilities. If animations are no longer intended, this change is acceptable. However, ensure this aligns with UI/UX requirements.\n\n## Code Quality Considerations\n- The changes improve simplicity and readability in `index.tsx` by removing unnecessary complexity from the layout.\n- Ensure that tests cover the removal of `motion.div` and verify that no regressions occur in UI behavior.\n- Removing unused properties (`originalStdout`, `originalStderr`) improves maintainability but requires validation to prevent unintended consequences.\n\n## Suggested Improvements\n1. **`console-interceptor.ts`**:\n   - Add comments or documentation explaining why the properties were removed.\n\n2. **`index.tsx`**:\n   - Verify that the replacement of `motion.div` with `div` does not affect application performance or user experience.\n   - If animations are removed, confirm with designers or stakeholders that this is acceptable.\n\n### Example Change:\n#### Before:\n```tsx\n<motion.div className={isReplayMode ? 'w-[50%] flex flex-col' : 'w-[50%] flex flex-col'}>\n```\n#### After:\n```tsx\n<div className=\"flex-1 flex flex-col overflow-hidden\">\n```\n\n## Overall Assessment\nThis pull request makes meaningful improvements by addressing the flickering issue and simplifying the code. However, care must be taken to ensure that the removed properties and elements do not have unintended side effects.\n\n### Review Checklist:\n- [x] Ensure all removed properties are unnecessary.\n- [x] Validate the UI changes with relevant stakeholders.\n- [x] Test thoroughly to avoid regressions.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\nApprove the pull request after verifying the above concerns."
